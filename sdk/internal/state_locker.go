// StateLocker implements a two state lock algorithm that enabled lock free operations inside a state
// and a global lock for switching between states. At every time, only one state is active and one cold state.
// States are represented by int numbers 0 and 1.
//
// This was inspired by the algorithm used on the prometheus client library that can be found at:
// https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/blob/e7776d2c54305c1b62fdb113b5a7e9b944c5c27e/prometheus/histogram.go#L227
//
// To execute operations within the same state, call `Start()` before the operation and call `End(idx)`
// to end this operation. The `idx` argument of `End()` is the index of the active state when the operation
// started and it is returned by the `Start()` method. It is recommended to defer the call to `End(idx)`.
//
// One can change the active state by calling `SwapActiveState(fn)`. `fn` is a function that will be executed *before*
// switching the active state. Operations such as preparing the new state shall be called by this function. This will
// wait in-flight operations to end.
//
// Example workflow:
// 1. State 0 is active.
// 1.1 Operations to the active state can happen with `Start()` and `End(idx)` methods.
// 2. Call to `SwitchState(fn)`
// 2.1 run `fn` function to prepare the new state
// 2.2 make state 1 active
// 2.3 wait in-flight operations of the state 0 to end.
// 3. State 1 is now active and every new operation are executed in it.
//
// `SwitchState(fn)` are synchronized with a mutex that can be access with the `Lock()` and `Unlock()` methods.
// Access to the cold state must also be synchronized to ensure the cold state is not in the middle of state switch
// since that could represent an invalid state.
